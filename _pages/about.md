Hello!  
======


A dedicated biologist trained in ecosystem ecology and microbiology, I currently work for the USDAÂ Biotechnology Regulatory Services where I protect agricultural and natural resources by ensuring safe development of genetically engineered organisms using a science-based regulatory framework. 
Previously I completed my PhD at the University of Florida, researching abstract concepts such as climate change, ecosystem functioning, and sustainable agricultural practices by using bioinformatics and DNA sequencing to better understand soil microorganisms. Soil microbes make up a major portion of the biodiversity in any ecosystem and are critically important for the overall health of the environment. My research has taken me to a wide range of places from tropical rainforests and urban cemeteries to the Mojave Desert and more. In my free time I enjoy running, hiking, and photography. Please see some of my photos below.
